The Password Generator [can be viewed here](https://gabbyj.github.io/password-generator/).

Responsive password generator that creates a random password between 4-50 characters. They can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, or numbers. You can adjust what characters are included in the password.

I find myself using password generators often for all these sites that require weekly password updates that can't repeat for 20 years ðŸ™„ so, why not create one for myself?
